## What is Onomaton?
Onomaton is a project that hopes to clear all problems about name creation. It is a program written for creative people like me, who constantly need new names and words for things.
Currently under development, Onomaton will serve for any kind of name, whether fictional names, names for products, groups, agendas, projects, companies, characters, even scientific names, and really anything you can think of that doesn't already have a name.
